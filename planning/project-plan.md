# Exercise Database Components

## Frontend (Client-Side):
- **UI/UX Framework:** Most likely Preact.
- **State Management:** If your application becomes complex, consider using state management libraries like Redux (for React) or Vuex (for Vue).
- **Styling:** Use CSS or a preprocessor like SASS/SCSS for styling your frontend components.
- **Forms Handling:** Libraries like Formik (React) or Vuelidate (Vue) can help with form handling and validation.

## Backend (Server-Side):
- **Node.js:** As you're coding in JavaScript, Node.js is a popular choice for server-side development.
- **Web Framework:** Choose a web framework to simplify server-side development. Express.js is a popular choice for Node.js.
- **Authentication:** Implement user authentication using libraries like Passport.js.
- **API:** Create a RESTful API to handle communication between the frontend and the database.

## Database:
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** Choose a database system. PostgreSQL or MySQL are common choices for relational databases. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL option.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** We will use prisma to communicate with the database.

## Backend API Endpoints:
- Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for users, topics, and problems.
- Use RESTful conventions for a clear and standardized API.

## Authentication and Authorization:
- Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or other authentication mechanisms.
- Handle authorization to ensure that users can only access and modify their own problems.

## Search Functionality:
- Implement search functionality for problems based on topics and keywords.
- Consider using a search engine library like Elasticsearch or incorporating full-text search features provided by your chosen database.

## PDF Generation:
- Use a library like pdf-lib for generating PDFs dynamically based on selected problems.

## Deployment:
- Choose a platform for deploying your application. Common choices include AWS, Heroku, or Vercel.
- Set up a database server or use a managed database service provided by cloud platforms.

## Testing:
- Implement unit testing for backend functions using a testing framework like Jest.
- Perform integration testing to ensure the seamless interaction of different components.

## Documentation:
- Document your API endpoints, data models, and any other relevant information.
- Consider using tools like Swagger for API documentation.

## Security:
- Implement security best practices, including input validation, sanitation, and protection against common security threats.
- Use HTTPS to secure data in transit.

## Version Control:
- Use a version control system like Git for tracking changes in your code.
