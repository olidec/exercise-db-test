Implementing a staging area for newly submitted exercises and a review process for crowd-sourcing involves adding additional features to your application. Here's a high-level outline of how you could approach this:

### 1. **Database Changes:**
   - Add a new table in your database to store staged exercises. This table should have a similar structure to your main `Problem` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE StagedProblems (
    StagedProblemID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Statement TEXT,
    Solution TEXT,
    DifficultyLevel VARCHAR(255),
    DateSubmitted DATETIME,
    UserID INT,
    TopicID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TopicID) REFERENCES Topics(TopicID)
);
```

### 2. **Submission Form:**
   - Create a submission form where users can enter LaTeX-formatted exercises.
   - When a user submits an exercise, store it in the `StagedProblems` table.

### 3. **Review Interface:**
   - Create a review interface where authorized users can see the list of staged exercises.
   - Allow reviewers to accept or reject exercises based on correctness, clarity, and adherence to guidelines.

### 4. **Review Process:**
   - When a reviewer accepts an exercise, move it from the `StagedProblems` table to the main `Problem` table.

### 5. **Permissions:**
   - Implement a role-based access control system to manage permissions. Only authorized users (reviewers) should be able to access the review interface.

### 6. **Notification System:**
   - Implement a notification system to alert reviewers when new exercises are submitted for review.

### 7. **Audit Trail:**
   - Keep an audit trail to track the history of exercises, including who submitted them and who reviewed/approved them.

### 8. **User Feedback:**
   - Allow reviewers to provide feedback to the submitter. This could be used for educational purposes or to suggest improvements.

### 9. **Integration with Main Database:**
   - Ensure that the process of moving exercises from the staging area to the main database is seamless and doesn't compromise data integrity.

### 10. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test the submission, review, and integration processes to identify and address any issues.

### 11. **Documentation:**
   - Document the submission and review processes for both submitters and reviewers.

### Example Submission Form (HTML):
```html
<!-- Submission Form -->
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    <!-- Exercise Statement (LaTeX) -->
    <label for="exerciseStatement">Exercise Statement:</label>
    <textarea id="exerciseStatement" name="exerciseStatement" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>

    <!-- Solution (LaTeX) -->
    <label for="exerciseSolution">Solution:</label>
    <textarea id="exerciseSolution" name="exerciseSolution" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>

    <!-- Difficulty Level -->
    <label for="difficultyLevel">Difficulty Level:</label>
    <select id="difficultyLevel" name="difficultyLevel">
        <option value="easy">Easy</option>
        <option value="medium">Medium</option>
        <option value="hard">Hard</option>
    </select>

    <!-- Topic Selection -->
    <label for="topic">Topic:</label>
    <select id="topic" name="topic">
        <!-- Populate with available topics from the database -->
        <option value="1">Algebra</option>
        <option value="2">Geometry</option>
        <!-- Add more topics as needed -->
    </select>

    <!-- Submit Button -->
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Exercise">
</form>
```

This form allows users to submit exercises. Upon submission, the data can be processed on the server side to store the exercise in the `StagedProblems` table.

Remember to implement server-side validation, sanitize user input, and handle potential security concerns, especially since this involves user-generated content.
